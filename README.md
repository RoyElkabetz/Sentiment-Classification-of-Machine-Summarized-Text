## TODO

### Code:
- [x] add BLEU and perplexity scores to T5 summarizer model
- [ ] plot loss and perplexity curves
- [ ] add an inference pipline to the T5 training class
- [ ] expand the IMDB summarized dataset to equal positive and negative samples for 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 max length summaries.
- [ ] arrange excisting code into .py and .ipynb files
- [ ] loose the older .ipynb summarizer pipline
- [ ] give links to CSV dataset files from Drive

## Report:
- [ ] write down a project report (up to 8 pages):
- [ ] 1. Introduction 
- [ ] 2. Methods
- [ ] 3. Experiments
- [ ] 4. Conclusions
- [ ] 5. Future work
